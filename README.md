# Two Sum Problem - C++ Solution

## Problem Description

The task is to find two numbers in the given array `nums` whose sum equals the target value. You need to return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. The solution should not use the same element twice.

### Example 1:
```cpp
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
